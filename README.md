# ExpandCollapseAnimator
Android animator of view's height whether it is an item of RecyclerView or ListView or any regular view

Key intents of that library are:

1. Fast (no layout steps, no onLayout(), no onMeasure() calls)

2. Loosely coupled, lightweight, minimal dependencies and ability to use with low level API

3. Animate any view whether it is a recyclerview's item or regular view

## Usage
It's just 2 classes:

a. VerticalClipLayout - add it to your xml

Control height with VerticalClipLayout.setClipCoef(0..1)

Clicks and drawing will be adjusted to provided coefficient. So you don't click an invisible element or get weird visual when animating.

b. ExpandCollapseAnimator - use it if you need to make common list behaviour:

while 1 item expands, all the other collapses.

// adds view to processing

ExpandCollapseAnimator.add(int position, VerticalClipLayout view) - adds view to processing

ExpandCollapseAnimator.remove(int position) - remove (for example, when view gone offscreen)

ExpandCollapseAnimator.setExpanding(int position) - to start expanding that view, all the other will start (or continue) collapsing

## RecyclerView Demo
You can find example code in project "app". If you run it on android device, you'll see a list of cards with different gradients (to simply distinguish them). When you click and item, it is expanded. Try it out.
